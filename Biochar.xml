      <h2>What is Biochar?</h2>
      <p>Biochar is a type of charcoal produced from organic materials, such as agricultural waste, wood chips, or crop residues, through a process called pyrolysis. Pyrolysis involves heating the organic material in the absence of oxygen, resulting in the production of a stable form of carbon-rich material known as biochar.</p>

    <section id="benefits">
      <h2>Benefits of Biochar</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Improves soil fertility and structure</li>
        <li>Enhances nutrient retention and availability</li>
        <li>Reduces greenhouse gas emissions</li>
        <li>Increases water retention in soil</li>
        <li>Reduces the need for synthetic fertilizers</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="how-to-make">
      <h2>How to Make Biochar</h2>
      <p>The process of making biochar involves heating organic materials in a low-oxygen environment, such as a kiln or pyrolysis reactor. This process converts the organic material into biochar while also producing byproducts such as bio-oil and syngas.</p>
